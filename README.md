# Iot project 2023, aka the Summer Survival Station
This is my small IoT project for the summer course held by Linnaeus University. I've named it the Summer Survival Station, and it reminds me to turn on the fan when it gets hot and to drink water. The SSS also send temperature &amp; humidity data plus the amount of water I've had to Ubidots to visualize the data.

You can find a more thorough description of the project [here](https://hackmd.io/@DanLar99/rJZir69dh).
